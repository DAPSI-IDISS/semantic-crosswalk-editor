# Semantic-Crosswalk-Editor

## Overview

The **purpose** of this project is to enhance the data portability of standards.
Although in the end for any structured data we start with XML as syntax.

Our **first milestone objective** is to provide within half a year a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to interested parties.

For the beginning, we have chosen the real-world scenario maintaining the syntax binding of the EU e-procurement (EU CEN Standard EN16931) scenario.

![EU Syntax Binding](docs/images/EN16931-SyntaxBinding.png)

With our MVP we want to show how domain experts are able to easily align their semantics - here given by the CEN technical committee 434 (EN16931-1) - with the related given syntax, in our showcase the e-procurement XML syntax Cross Industry Invoice (CII) defined by the UN/CEFACT.
