	- If VSCode complains about the 'Red Hat Commons' extension is not supported in Restricted Mode:  
	Go to **File > Preferences > Settings**, search for `security.workspace.trust.enabled` and uncheck it.

### Debugging Guides

- [Running and Debugging Your Extension](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extensions/debugging-extensions/)
- [Debugging in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging)
- [Diagnosing Terminal Issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Terminal-Issues#diagnosing-terminal-issues) - Particularly useful if error notifications or the terminal output not providing enough information (such as `The terminal process terminated with exit code: 1`)

## Binary Server Testing

### Testing a binary version of LemMinX

1. Copy the binary version of LemMinX to:

   | OS | Location (relative to root of repository) |
   | --- | --- |
   | Linux | `./vscode-xml/server/lemminx-linux` |
   | macOS | `./vscode-xml/server/lemminx-darwin-x86_64` |
   | Windows | `.\vscode-xml\server\lemminx-win32.exe` |

   Alternatively, you can set the `xml.server.binary.path` preference to specify the path of the binary to run.

1. Make sure that you set `xml.server.preferBinary` to `true`,
disable any [LemMinX extensions](https://github.com/DAPSI-IDISS/vscode-xml/blob/master/docs/Extensions.md)
by commenting out `xml.extension.jars` in your `settings.json`,
and uninstall or disable any VS Code extensions that provide extra LemMinX features.

1. Launch vscode-xml in development mode, and double check that the binary server is running by checking the server logging (Output > XML Support)
