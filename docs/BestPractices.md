# Best Practices
## Define Strategy

(to be continued)


## NOTE:
Data and experience is still to be collected and evaluated. Our current approach is instead of suggesting a "best" practice to try to enable the integration of our tools with people's current workflows-- we have some ideas based upon our experience (that is flowing into these tools) but nothing is set in stone and features are being added as new needs arrise and new desires ("if only it could do..") are exposed. While new tools and paradigms will inevitabily change and modify the workflows, it remains to seen where this road goes and what lessions (positive as also negative) are to be learned.
