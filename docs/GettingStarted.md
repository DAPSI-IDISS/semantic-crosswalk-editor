## Open the Syntax-Mapping Sample File

To quickly get started, download the [Syntax-Mapping sample file](./../sample-data/syntax-mapping.xml) from the GitHub repository and open it in VS Code. This sample will be also used in the following documentation to provide a straight forward walkthrough.

Make sure to trust the file (Open) when the following prompt appears:  
![ Trust File ](./images/open_trust.png)

The default VS Code workspace with the extension enabled and the sample file opened should look like the following image:
