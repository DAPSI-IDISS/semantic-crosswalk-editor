## Move Outline to Semantic Crosswalk Explorer

Drag the Outline from the Explorer into the Semantic Crosswalk Explorer to move the Outline View below XML View (this way you get all relevant core views combined into one neat panel):

## Adjust Side Panel & Views Size

Drag the line between the Side Panel and the Code Editor to adjust for your needs:

![ Resize Side Panel ](./images/resize_sidepanel.gif)

Drag the lines between the Views for a better overview in the Side Panel depending on your use-case:

Views can be also completely collapsed/expanded by clicking on the arrow icons (`v` or `>` before the LABEL) or directly on the LABEL (e.g. on "XML VIEW"):
