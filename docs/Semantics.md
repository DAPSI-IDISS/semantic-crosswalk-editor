## The Messy Word

### Example: Address
#### US Centric Approach
#### Japanese Paradigm
#### Addresses in UK and Ireland
#### Addresses without names?

In Ghana, finding your way around can be a challeng since properties often don't have a house number or name and street signs are rarely visible,
local landmarks like bars, banks or even trees are used instead to help people find their way. Using palm trees, speed bumps, street vendors, etc.
works but the system is far from persistant. Palm tree can be cut down and street vendors can change their location.

Because of this the World Bank a few years ago initiated a program to create digital adresses. 3,782 street signs were erected, and 12,952 signs
were posted in 2015. Street names are, however, not persistant and families and groups can easily move to have streets named or renamed. To address
the persistancy issue Ghana uses also now digital addresses.

Digital addresses have the form CODE-XXX-XXX.

Example: The address AK-039-5028 is for the Kumasi Main Post Office. In a deconstructed form, AK-039 is the postal code for the area, A refers to the region of the location (Ashanti Region), while K refers to the district (Kumasi District), 5028
