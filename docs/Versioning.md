# Versioning

Version control is the only reasonable way to keep track of changes in code, manuscripts, presentations, and data analysis projects. 

## Versioning with Git (and Github)

At the core of IDISS for versioning is "Git". 

Git (/ɡɪt/) is an extremely popular software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).
